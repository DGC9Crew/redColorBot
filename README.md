# Red Color Bot

This program is a Java program made with the jMonkeyEngine demonstrating the previous program of a single-layer perceptron neural network in action.

In this program, you see a 3D cube with a color, which could either be *maybe red* or *maybe another color*. You must state what color it is by pressing Y or N.
This will be treated as training data for the neural network, and it will then guess the color, learning depending of it got it wrong or right. 
Soon enough, after many more intervals and tries, the neural network will have their weights adjusted accordinely in order to get the color guess almost all the time.

*This is a single-layer perceptron, meaning it is linear, compared to a non-linear multi-layered perceptron, so this is not exactly the best source for neural networking info.*
